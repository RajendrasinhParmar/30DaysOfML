# Day 10 of 30 Days Of ML Code

## Introduction to ML Course Lesson 5

### Overfitting and Underfitting

In this lesson there are following concepts
1. Overfitting - When we capture patterns and train the model with so many small chunks of data, It'll try to predict the value for the new data from the learned models and it'll be always near to the values already known. This is called over fitting. This gives inaccurate results and are not so useful.

2. Underfitting - When we capture patterns and train the model with very small number of chunks with so many different verity of data present in a single chunks, the model will not fit properly and will provide inaccurate results.

### Random Forests

In this lesson we learn the RandomForestRegressor from sklearn library.
