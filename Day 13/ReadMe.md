# Day 13 of 30 Days Of ML Code

## Intermediate Machine Learning Lesson 4

### Pipelines

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use pipelines to clean up your modeling code.

Follow the notebook [Pipelines](./pipelines.ipynb) for lesson details.

#### Exercise

As a part of the exercise for the forth lesson we have predicted the values of house prices using the pipeline.

The associated exercise with the forth lesson of the course is provided in [Exercise: Pipelines](./exercise-pipelines.ipynb)

Data used for the exercise is available under the folder [home-data-for-ml-course](./home-data-for-ml-course)
Submission for the exercise is available in [submission_pipelines.csv](./home-data-for-ml-course/submission_pipelines.csv)


## Intermediate Machine Learning Lesson 5
### Cross-Validation

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use cross-validation for better measures of model performance.

Follow the notebook [Cross-Validation](./cross-validation.ipynb) for lesson details.

#### Exercise

As a part of the exercise for the fifth lesson we have worked on cross-validation examples.

The associated exercise with the fifth lesson of the course is provided in [Exercise: Cross-Validation](./exercise-cross-validation.ipynb)
