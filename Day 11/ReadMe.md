# Day 11 of 30 Days Of ML Code

## Introduction to ML Course Lesson 7

### Machine Learning Competitions

In this lesson, there is an exercise to predict the prices from the new test dataset.

Follow the notebook [Machine Learning Competitions](./machine-learning-competitions.ipynb) for lesson details.

We will train the model on the full data set. Once it's trained we will use that model to predict the sale price for the houses from the new dataset.

The associated exercise with the seventh lesson of the course is provided in [Exercise: Machine Learning Competitions](./exercise-machine-learning-competitions.ipynb)
